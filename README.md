#### A Game where you:
- Code Bots With An API.
- Watch Them Play A Simple Board Game.
- Try To Defeat Your Friends and Foes.
- Get Smarter.
- Try Out Machine Learning Concepts.

#### Rules of the Game:
- There are 2-4 Players (bots) on a game board of size H x W
- Each Player Has A Color (and a bot_id)
- When a Player moves onto a cell if it's empty it becomes their color
- If the cell is not empty then the cell becomes grey
- The Player with the most cells at the end of the game wins
